# FarmSight - Game Guide

## Welcome to FarmSight!

FarmSight is an educational farming simulation game that teaches sustainable agriculture practices using real NASA satellite data. Learn how to manage resources efficiently while maximizing crop yields and maintaining environmental health.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your Account
- Sign up with your email and choose a unique username
- Your account tracks your progress, score, and achievements

### 2. Name Your Farm
- Choose a memorable name for your farm
- You'll start with 12 empty plots ready for planting

### 3. Starting Resources
- **Money**: $1,000 - Use this to buy crops, livestock, and supplies
- **Water**: 100 units - Essential for irrigation
- **Fertilizer**: 50 units - Boosts crop growth (use wisely!)
- **Sustainability Score**: 0 - Earn points through eco-friendly practices

## Game Mechanics

### Planting Crops

1. **Select an Empty Plot** - Click on any gray plot
2. **Choose Your Crop** - Each crop has different characteristics:
   - **Corn** üåΩ: 90 days, moderate water needs, good profit
   - **Wheat** üåæ: 120 days, lower water needs, high sustainability score
   - **Tomatoes** üçÖ: 75 days, high water needs, fast growing
   - **Lettuce** ü•¨: 45 days, low water needs, best sustainability
   - **Soybeans** ü´ò: 100 days, moderate needs, excellent for soil health
   - **Carrots** ü•ï: 70 days, low water needs, good profit

### Crop Growth Stages

Crops progress through 5 stages:
1. **Seed** - Just planted
2. **Sprout** - Beginning to grow
3. **Growing** - Active growth phase
4. **Mature** - Almost ready
5. **Ready to Harvest** - Maximum yield available

### Managing Your Plots

**Irrigation (üíß 10 Water)**
- Increases soil moisture to 100%
- Prevents crop stress and health loss
- Monitor the soil moisture indicator on each plot
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Low moisture (<30%) will damage crop health

**Fertilization (‚ö° 5 Fertilizer)**
- One-time boost per crop cycle
- Improves growth rate
- **Warning**: Overuse reduces sustainability score!
- Use strategically on high-value crops

**Harvesting**
- Available when growth stage reaches "Ready"
- Yield = Base Yield √ó (Crop Health / 100)
- Earn money based on yield √ó price per unit
- Gain sustainability points for successful harvests

### NASA Environmental Data

FarmSight integrates real-world NASA satellite data concepts:

**üå°Ô∏è Temperature**
- Optimal: 15-30¬∞C
- Affects crop growth rate
- Outside optimal range reduces yield

**‚òÅÔ∏è Rainfall**
- Reduces irrigation needs
- High rainfall = save water resources
- Low rainfall = more irrigation required

**üíß Soil Moisture Index**
- From NASA SMAP satellite
- Indicates natural water availability
- Use to plan irrigation schedules

**üå± Vegetation Index (NDVI)**
- Measures overall plant health
- Values above 0.6 indicate healthy crops
- Monitor farm-wide vegetation coverage

### Livestock Management

**Adding Animals**
- üêî **Chicken**: $150 - Quick return, low maintenance
- üêë **Sheep**: $300 - Moderate cost, wool production
- üêÑ **Cow**: $500 - High cost, milk production

**Animal Care**
- **Feed** regularly ($10 per feeding)
- Maintains health and happiness at 100%
- Neglect leads to decreased productivity
- Happy animals = bonus sustainability points

### Resource Management

**Earning Money**
- Harvest crops and sell yield
- Higher health crops = better profits
- Strategic timing maximizes revenue

**Water Conservation**
- Monitor rainfall predictions
- Irrigate only when necessary (<50% moisture)
- Efficient water use = sustainability bonus

**Fertilizer Strategy**
- Limited supply, use wisely
- Best for high-value crops (tomatoes, soybeans)
- Overuse damages soil health long-term

### Sustainability Scoring

**Earn Points For:**
- ‚úÖ Harvesting crops (+10-30 points based on crop type)
- ‚úÖ Efficient irrigation (when moisture <50%)
- ‚úÖ Growing eco-friendly crops (lettuce, soybeans)
- ‚úÖ Maintaining healthy livestock
- ‚úÖ Balanced resource usage

**Lose Points For:**
- ‚ùå Over-fertilization (-5 points per excessive use)
- ‚ùå Wasting water (irrigating when moisture >80%)
- ‚ùå Neglecting livestock health
- ‚ùå Letting crops die from poor care

### Farm Health

- Tracks overall soil quality (0-100%)
- Affected by fertilizer use and crop rotation
- High health = better yields
- Maintain above 70% for optimal farming

## Tips for Success

### Beginner Strategies
1. **Start Small** - Plant 4-6 plots initially to learn mechanics
2. **Choose Fast Crops** - Lettuce (45 days) provides quick returns
3. **Monitor Moisture** - Check plots daily, irrigate below 50%
4. **Balance Resources** - Don't overspend on livestock early

### Intermediate Tactics
1. **Crop Rotation** - Vary crops to maintain soil health
2. **Weather Watching** - Use NASA data to predict irrigation needs
3. **Fertilizer Timing** - Apply when crops reach "Growing" stage
4. **Diversification** - Mix fast and slow-growing crops

### Advanced Optimization
1. **Sustainability Focus** - Prioritize high eco-score crops
2. **Resource Efficiency** - Minimize waste for maximum points
3. **Livestock Integration** - Animals boost overall farm score
4. **Data-Driven Decisions** - Use environmental indicators to plan

## Educational Concepts

### Real-World NASA Applications

**SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive)**
- Measures soil moisture globally
